A conference paper describing the functioning of the predecesor to this ontology - a conceptually identical version but with a project-specific namespace and one that didn't derive from any Agreements ontology - was first published at MODSIM 2015:

A second conference paper, updating the above but still not indicating derivation from an Agreements ontology was published at SciDataCon 2016:
